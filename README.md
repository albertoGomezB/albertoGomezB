## 🧠 About Me  

I’m a **Senior Backend Engineer** with over **6 years of experience** designing, building, and scaling **cloud-native systems on AWS**.  
My focus is on owning and evolving **secure**, **high-performance**, and **maintainable** architectures that blend strong backend engineering with cloud automation and thoughtful design.

I design and own backend architectures using **Java 21**, **Spring Boot**, and **AWS**, applying clean architecture and modern patterns to deliver systems that evolve gracefully over time.  
Currently contributing to a **multi-country digital signature and document management platform**, where I lead design and integration of serverless, event-driven components on AWS.

✨ For me, technology is a craft — combining precision, creativity, and structure. Every architecture is an opportunity to simplify complexity and build systems that last.
